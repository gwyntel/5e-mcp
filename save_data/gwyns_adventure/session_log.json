    "summary": "Session 1: The Nexhaven Heist\n\nGwyneth, an elf technomancer and former criminal, accepted a data extraction job from her fixer Vex for 200 credits. She infiltrated Warehouse 9-K-7 in Sector 9, bypassing external wards and entering through a rooftop access hatch. After cracking a biometric vault lock, she secured a corporate data-core but triggered a security drone.\n\nIn the ensuing combat, Gwyneth took critical damage (reduced to 2 HP) but destroyed the drone using Magic Missile after her Fire Bolt nearly finished it. She escaped with Vex's help, earning 250 credits total (200 base + 50 hazard pay). She's now wanted by CorpSec and recovering in a safehouse.\n\nCurrent Status: 2/7 HP, 1/2 spell slots remaining, 250 credits in pocket, one energy cell salvaged from the drone. Next session should address her injuries and the CorpSec manhunt."
